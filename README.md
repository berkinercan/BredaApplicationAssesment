Game about Reflections
This repository contains my attempt to write a game with C++ using SDL Library. 

# The Idea

My idea was to move around with a character and move mirrors to direct the laser source to it's correct destination. 

# The progress

I have managed to implement main character with the ability to move around the map with animations. 

In order to do that I have followed a reddit post called 'asdasdad'. It is a step by step video tutorial series that implements a clone of the game called "Gamestory". Even though Cavestory and my game have nothing in common. I found the tutorials relatively easy to follow follow and decided to code along until my ideas and cavestory start to differ, 

I got stuct on the part, where I am supposed to draw a mirror on the map. Even though I have followed exactly same steps to draw the player. I could not manage to draw the mirror on the screen. 

# Implementation Details 

For the implementation, I have used C++ as the programming language. For the assets, I have used the files on  "www.asdasdasdasd..com". The Graphics Library that I have used is SDL2.0.

## The classes:
* Input.cpp - This class is responsible from reading the keyboard inputs with SDL Library
* Game.cpp class is responsible from getting the Inputs and call the necessary movement functions for the player object.

# Challenges
Attempting to implemet a game is a very detailed and rewarding task. The following tasks was very challenging for me;
* Using the Visual Studio IDE comprehensively (Tutorial shows the steps for Eclipse, I was not always the same steps for Visual Studio)
* Importing SDL Library and the linker setup
*  Drawing additional game objects. I believe I could have succeded on this challenge as well, If I could have more time.
